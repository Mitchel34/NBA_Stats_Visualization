# NBA STATS VISUALIZATION
This project provides interactive visualizations of NBA data from the 2024-2025 season. The web application features multiple pages that analyze different aspects of NBA statistics, from player performance to team dynamics, using various data visualization techniques including charts, graphs, and interactive elements.


## The visualizations aim to answer the following questions:

## 1. Who will win NBA League MVP?
## 2. Which team will win the 2025 NBA Championship?
## 3. How do team fouls impact overall wins?
## 4. How were teams and players impacted by major trades this season?
